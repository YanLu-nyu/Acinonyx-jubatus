# Cheetah
**Cheetah**: An CNN framework for Real-Time Vision Tasks (e.g., object detection, re-identification, tracking). Prior to our implementation, I listed some influencing papers in real-time vision tasks and summarized their common useful components. Based on these components, we built **Cheetah**, an API for real-time vision tasks. Unlike [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), [deep-person-reid](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid) and [pysot](https://github.com/STVIR/pysot), **Cheetah** paid more attention on the real-time feature and implemented all novel efficient components for current vision tasks. Inspired by [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), we would try to implement Cheetah by Pytorch.
